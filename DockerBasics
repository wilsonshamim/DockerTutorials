Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to devlop, deploy and run applications with container.

contanierization advantage:
Flexible: Even the most complex applications can be containerized.
Lightweight: Containers leverage and share the host kernel.
Interchangeable: You can deploy updates and upgrades on-the-fly.
Portable: You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.
Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas.
Stackable: You can stack services vertically and on-the-fly.

Image: Image is an executable package that include everything, a code, libraries, runtime env, env variables and configurations files.

container: It is a runtime instance of an image. what the image become runtime memory when executed. i.e an image is a running state or 
user process.

Container VS Virtual machine:
A container runs natively on Linux and shares the kernel of the host machine with other containers. 
It runs a discrete process, taking no more memory than any other executable, making it lightweight.

By contrast, a virtual machine (VM) runs a full-blown “guest” operating system with virtual access to host resources through a hypervisor.
In general, VMs provide an environment with more resources than most applications need.
